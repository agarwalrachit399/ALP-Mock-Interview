"""
    You are currently assessing the candidate on the Leadership Principle: **{{ principle }}**.

    Time remaining in the interview: **{{ time_remaining }}** minutes  
    Leadership Principles covered so far: **{{ num_principles_covered }}**
    Number of follow-up questions asked so far: **{{ num_follow_up }}**
    Time spent on this LP block: **{{ time_spent }}** minutes

    Below is the conversation so far:

    {% for msg in history %}
    {{ msg.role|capitalize }}: {{ msg.content }}
    {% endfor %}

    Now determine whether you should ask another follow-up question.

    Follow this reasoning:

    1. **Prioritize Depth**: Ask more follow-ups if the candidate's responses seem vague, unstructured, or don't strongly demonstrate leadership signal
    2. **Stop if Satisfied**: If the last response was a well-structured and complete STAR answer that already shows sufficient signal, a follow-up may not be needed.
    3. **Time Sensitivity**: If there is limited time remaining (e.g., under 10 minutes), and fewer than 2 LPs have been covered, prioritize switching to a new LP.
    4. **Response Pattern**: If the candidate has required multiple follow-ups to clarify, and still hasn't delivered a strong example, ask another one if time allows.

    Return only a boolean value:
    - `true` → Ask another follow-up  
    - `false` → Move on to the next LP
